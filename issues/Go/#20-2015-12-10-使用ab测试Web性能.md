# 使用ab测试Web性能

ab - Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool

## Web服务程序

gohttp.go:

```go
package main
 
import (
    "net/http"
)
 
func SayHello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    w.Write([]byte("Hello"))
}
 
func main() {
    http.HandleFunc("/hello", SayHello)
    err := http.ListenAndServe(":8001", nil)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

启动Web服务器程序:

```
$ go run gohttp.go
```

测试可以访问:

```
$ curl http://localhost:8001/hello
Hello
```

## 用ab进行压力测试

```
$ ab -n 10000 -c 100 http://localhost:8001/hello
